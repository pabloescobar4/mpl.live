Sent in to bowl first after South Africa won the toss, the Indians did not get off to the best start, with the openers failing to leave an impact. However, Mithali Raj and Harmanpreet Kaur steadied the ship, but their dismissal sparked a collapse as the side could only manage 23 runs in the remaining 13 overs, with the loss of 5 wickets. The middle order has always posed a problem for the Indian side, and the absence of a big hitter lower down the order seems to be an area they should work on ahead of the World Cup. ",
