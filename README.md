## About Us
We are from Masai School, in the course of the fourth unit here, we learned nodejs, express and mongoDB in this unit.

At the end of our 4th unit, we were given a project as a part of our curriculum. We were divided into groups and each group was assigned a website to clone. My group had to clone [MPL](https://www.mpl.live/).

## About MPL
MPL is a gaming platform where you can win amazing rewards and cash by playing your favorite games. Here you can have a great gaming experience and fun , you can find a variety of tournaments and 1v1 battles around the clock. In our clone, we have tried to cover all the important functionalities and pages one would find over there. We use a technology stack containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, nodejs, express, MongoDB.

## Tech stack
HTML, CSS, JS, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB.
